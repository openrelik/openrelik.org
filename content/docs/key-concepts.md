### Forensic Artifacts

- **Upload and store artifacts:** Forensic artifacts are uploaded to the platform and stored as files on the server.
- **Organize:** Users can create folders to efficiently organize and manage their uploaded forensic artifacts.

### Workflows

- **Docker Containers:** Workflows are built using independent Docker containers, ensuring isolation and portability.
- **Communication:** These containers interact with the core system through task queue signals, enabling seamless coordination and data exchange.
- **Pipelines and Parallel Execution:** Workflows can be executed as sequential pipelines or as groups of parallel tasks, providing flexibility and optimization for various forensic investigations.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Workflows are designed and created using an intuitive user interface, empowering users to easily define and configure their forensic analysis processes.
- **Copy and Share:** Workflows can be easily copied and shared between users, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.
- **Workflow Templates:** Users can create and store workflow templates, allowing for quick and efficient reuse of workflows for different evidence sets.

### Artifact Summaries

- **LLM Integration:** The platform can connect to Large Language Model (LLM) services to generate concise and informative summaries of forensic artifacts, aiding investigators in quickly understanding their relevance and potential significance.

### Additional Considerations

- **Open-Source:** The platform is open-source, encouraging community contributions, transparency, and continuous improvement.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to scale efficiently, accommodating growing volumes of forensic data.
