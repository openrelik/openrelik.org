Workflows orchestrate the execution of digital forensic tasks within a distributed, containerized environment. They provide a structured framework for designing and automating complex investigative processes.

-----

### Architecture and Execution

Each task within a workflow runs in an **isolated Docker container** to prevent process interference. Communication between containers and the core system is managed by a **Celery task queue**, ensuring robust coordination and data exchange.

Workflows support two primary execution models, which can be combined:

  * **Pipelines**: Tasks are executed **sequentially**, with the output of one task serving as the input for the next. This model is for processes with linear dependencies.
  * **Parallel Groups**: Tasks within a group are executed **concurrently**. This model is used to maximize resource utilization for independent tasks.
  * **Combined Models**: Pipelines and Parallel Groups can be **nested** to construct complex workflows with both sequential and concurrent stages.

-----

### Management and Collaboration

A user interface is provided for visual workflow creation. Workflows can be **shared** between users or **copied and modified** to support collaboration and experimentation. Frequently used workflows can be saved as **templates** to enable rapid and consistent deployment across different investigations.
