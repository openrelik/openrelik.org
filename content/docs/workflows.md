### Independent containers

Workflows are the engines of the platform, orchestrating the execution of digital forensic tasks within a distributed, containerized environment. Each task within a workflow runs within its own Docker container, ensuring isolation and preventing interference between different processes.

Communication between containers and the core system is done through the Celery task queue. This enables seamless coordination and data exchange, even across complex workflows.

### Flexible Execution Patterns

Workflows offer two distinct execution modes:

- **Pipelines:** Tasks are executed sequentially, with the output of one task serving as the input for the next. This is ideal for scenarios where a clear dependency exists between tasks.
- **Parallel Groups:** Tasks within a group are executed concurrently, maximizing resource utilization and accelerating the overall workflow. This mode is well-suited for tasks that can operate independently.

### Intuitive Workflow Creation

A user-friendly interface streamlines the creation of workflows, even for those without extensive technical expertise. It simplifies the arrangement of tasks, while visual cues clarify relationships and dependencies.

### Collaboration and Sharing

Workflows can be effortlessly shared between users, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange within the community. Additionally, workflows can be copied and modified, encouraging experimentation and customization.

### Reusable Workflow Templates

Frequently used workflows can be saved as templates, facilitating rapid deployment for different artifact sets. This saves valuable time and promotes consistency in forensic investigations.

### In Summary

The platform's workflow system empowers users to design and execute sophisticated digital forensic investigations within a flexible, containerized environment. The combination of intuitive design, collaboration features, and reusable templates streamlines the investigative process, allowing practitioners to focus on extracting insights from artifacts.
